# Standard textbooks and monographs on Boolean functions

These books are widely used in the cryptography community but I cannot verify complete bibliographic details (ISBN, exact publication year, edition) without access to the physical copies or publisher databases. Use these as reference material but verify details before citing formally.

## Recommended books (unverified bibliographic details)

- **Cusick, T.W. & Stănica, P.** — *Cryptographic Boolean Functions and Applications*
  - Publisher: Academic Press (first edition 2009), CRC Press (second edition, possibly 2017)
  - Notes: Standard reference for Walsh spectrum, nonlinearity, correlation immunity. Verify ISBN and edition before citing.

- **Carlet, Claude** — *Boolean Functions for Cryptography and Coding Theory*
  - Publisher: Cambridge University Press
  - Notes: Comprehensive modern treatment. Verify publication year (possibly 2020 or 2021) and ISBN before citing.

- **Crama, Yves & Hammer, Peter L.** — *Boolean Functions: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications*
  - Publisher: Cambridge University Press
  - Notes: General Boolean function theory. Verify year (possibly 2011) and ISBN before citing.

- **Tokareva, Natalia** — *Bent Functions: Results and Applications to Cryptography*
  - Publisher: Academic Press (possibly 2015)
  - Notes: Specialized on bent functions. Verify publication details before citing.

## How to use these

- Consult these books for conceptual understanding of Walsh spectra, nonlinearity, and cryptographic criteria.
- Before adding to `papers.bib` for formal citation, verify exact details from:
  - Publisher websites
  - Library catalogs (WorldCat, Library of Congress)
  - Citation databases (MathSciNet, Zentralblatt MATH)
  - Your institution's library
