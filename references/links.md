# Implementation and non-peer-reviewed resources

These links are useful for implementation details and context but are not peer-reviewed scholarly sources. Keep them separate from `papers.bib` to avoid conflating with academic citations.

- PyTorch Blog: HadaCore — Tensor Core Accelerated Hadamard Transform
  - https://pytorch.org/blog/hadacore/
  - Notes: performance highlights and engineering context; marketing-oriented. Use as an overview, not a citation for algorithms.

- Meta-PyTorch Applied AI — Hadamard Transform CUDA Kernel (repository)
  - https://github.com/meta-pytorch/applied-ai/tree/main/kernels/cuda/inference/hadamard_transform
  - Notes: production kernel code reference; implementation can change over time.

- Dao-AILab — Fast Hadamard Transform (CUDA, PyTorch bindings)
  - https://github.com/Dao-AILab/fast-hadamard-transform
  - Notes: widely used OSS implementation; benchmark claims vary by GPU and settings; treat numbers as indicative, not authoritative.
